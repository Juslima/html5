        <h2>Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another
            way to organize elements on a page? </h2>
        <p>Another way to organize elements on a webpage without using relative or absolute positioning is by using "CSS
            Grid." CSS Grid Layout, commonly known as Grid, is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create
            complex and grid-based page layouts. It's a powerful and flexible alternative to traditional positioning
            methods and provides precise control over both rows and columns.

            With CSS Grid, you can define a grid container and its child elements, specifying their placement,
            alignment, and sizing within the grid. This method is particularly useful for designing grid-based web page
            layouts, such as those found in responsive web design and multi-column designs.

            CSS Grid is an excellent choice for organizing content into structured, well-defined grids, and it offers an
            effective way to control the layout of elements without relying on relative or absolute positioning.</p>
